# SSBM Fox Detector

## About

A [keras](https://keras.io/) FRCNN to detect Fox in Super Smash Bros Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube.  The FRCNN object detector was written by [yhenon](https://github.com/yhenon) and the orignal repo can be seen [here](https://github.com/yhenon/keras-frcnn).  The gameplay used to train and test the model is from VGBootcamp ([twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/vgbootcamp) & [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1J3QuIftjOq9iv_rr7Egw)).  The model was trained on the [AMI provided by PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/20/pre-configured-amazon-aws-deep-learning-ami-with-python/).

*TODO: add links to files including: training images, model.hdf5, & output images*
